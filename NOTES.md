# Development Notes

## HTTP Request Handling

- Prefer to use `fetch` or `axios` for handling HTTP requests.
- Avoid using `XMLHttpRequest` due to limitations and complexity.

## Framework Preferences

- Favor using `Vite.js` or `Next.js` for better development experience and
  performance.

## GraphQL Server

- Better to have GraphQL server in developer mode.
- Enables deeper insights into data structures and queries.
